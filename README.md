A Matching App testing your memory using a 4x4 board with 16 images, each image having a pair. The goal is to match all 8 pairs in different modes: one player mode, two player mode and timed mode. Every time a new board is craeted the images are randomly shuffled. Best visual and graphics will occur when simulator is an iPhone 8 Plus.
Focused on incorporating animations in Swift.
